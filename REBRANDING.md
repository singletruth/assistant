# Rebranding Process Documentation

This document outlines the step-by-step process followed to rebrand the Open WebUI project to Singletruth Assistant. This can serve as a guide for future rebranding efforts or for understanding how the current rebranding was implemented.

## 1. Project Assessment

### Identify Brand Elements
- Application name: "Open WebUI" â†’ "Singletruth Assistant"
- Visual assets: Logo, favicon, and UI elements
- Color scheme: New teal/dark green with light blue accents

### Identify Files to Modify
We conducted a thorough search of the codebase to identify all instances of "Open WebUI" that needed to be updated:
- Source code files (.ts, .js, .svelte)
- Backend Python files (.py)
- Configuration files
- Translation files
- Static assets (images, icons)
- HTML templates

## 2. Code Modification Process

### 1. Update Core Constants
First, we modified the central constants that define the application name:
- `src/lib/constants.ts`: Updated `APP_NAME`
- `backend/open_webui/env.py`: Updated `WEBUI_NAME` variable

### 2. Update Backend References
- Modified Python files to reflect the new branding
- Updated API descriptions and documentation
- Modified version information output

### 3. Update Frontend References
- Changed HTML metadata and title tags
- Updated notification messages
- Modified version check messages
- Updated references in UI components

### 4. Internationalization
- Updated translation keys and values in English locale file
- Ensured all brand name instances were consistent

### 5. Replace Visual Assets
- Created new logo with the Singletruth branding
- Generated favicon in various sizes
- Updated static asset references

## 3. Testing Process

### Visual Inspection
- Manually verified all UI screens for correct branding
- Checked browser tab titles, notifications, and system messages

### Functional Testing
- Tested notification system with new branding
- Verified version check functionality
- Tested UI responsiveness with new assets

## 4. Documentation Updates

### Version Control
- Created a dedicated Git branch for rebranding changes
- Made atomic commits with clear messages
- Documented all changes in the repository

### Documentation Files
- Created CHANGELOG.md to track the rebranding change
- Created MODIFICATIONS.md with specific code changes
- Updated README.md with new branding information

## 5. Repository Management

### GitHub Setup
- Created a new repository named "assistant" under the Singletruth organization
- Pushed the rebranded codebase to the repository
- Set up appropriate branch protection and access controls

## Best Practices for Future Rebranding

1. **Search Thoroughly**: Use grep/search tools to find all instances of the brand name
2. **Document Changes**: Keep detailed records of all modifications
3. **Use Version Control**: Make rebranding changes in a dedicated branch
4. **Test Extensively**: Verify all UI elements after rebranding
5. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all documentation reflects the new branding
6. **Consider Automation**: For large projects, consider creating scripts to automate repetitive changes

## Tools Used

- Git for version control
- Text editor with search and replace across files
- Image editing software for logo and favicon generation
- GitHub API for repository management
